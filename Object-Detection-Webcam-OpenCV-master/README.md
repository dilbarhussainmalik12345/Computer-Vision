# Object Detection in Videos using OpenCV

## About
This is 3 of 3 notebook that shows the use of OpenCV to detect objects in video from webcams. 
Fist notebook 1/3 shows the implementation of OpenCV to detect Object in images which can be found [here](https://github.com/deep28vish/Object-Detection-Images-OpenCV). [Second Notebook](https://github.com/deep28vish/Object-detection-Videos-OpenCV) is Object detectio on Videos.

These are sample codes ready to run without any prior knowledge of AI, ML DNN, CNN these 50 lines are just plain simple ready to run.

## Requirements
* [Opencv(cv2)](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
* [Cascade classifiers](https://github.com/deep28vish/Object-Detection-Images-OpenCV/tree/master/haar_cascades)
## Contents
* haar_cascades[Folder with all the required classifiers]
* OBJECT_DETECTION_WEBCAM_COLORISED.py
* OBJECT_DETECTION_WEBCAM_GRAY.py
    
## Inspiration
* [SENTDEX](https://pythonprogramming.net/)

## Takeaway
This is just to see how to load classifiers and execute it using OPENCV in python for webcam Videos.
